# Module 1: About Page Project
Imagine you are building yourself a professional website to share and promote your work as an individual (think portfolio site, not a business or consulting site). Your task for this project is to create the about page.

An about page is an opportunity to introduce who you are and what you stand for within a particular context (in this case, the profession of your choice). The content needs to be professional but does not need to be formal. It is ok and appropriate to allow your personality to shine through.

## Requirements
- [ ] HTML page (name this file index.html)
- [ ] CSS file (name this file styles.css)
- [ ] assets folder (with any images needed in it)
- [ ] docs folder (with live website in itâ€”remember to update all files in this folder if you make edits)
- [ ] code needs to be valid
- [ ] code needs to be accessible
- [ ] site needs to be published (i.e. "live" on the web)
